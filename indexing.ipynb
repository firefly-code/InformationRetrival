According to\\nVECER, 1,036 respondents were classified by age and residence, but\\nthe paper did not explain the methodology or give the margin of\\nerror.

Residents of Skopje\\nranked the politicians in a slightly different order from the\\nranking given by the whole sample: Gligorov, Tupurkovski, Frckovski,\\nAndov, Gosev, Branko Crvenkovski, Vlado Popovski, Petrov, Nikola\\nPopovski, and Stevo Crvenkovski.\\nThe results of a series of opinion polls conducted by the Agency\\nfor Public Opinion Research and published \"exclusively\" by the\\nSkopje weekly PULS newspaper, confirmed Gligorov\\'s substantial lead\\nin popularity among political figures. According to the 31 December\\n1993 issue of PULS (pages 16-18), the agency gathered the data by\\nmeans of telephone interviews with 300 residents in the Republic of\\nMacedonia during 20-24 December.

For example, the DP was about twice\\nas popular in Skopje as elsewhere, getting 12.1 percent in the\\ncapital; the VMRO-DPMNE was more popular in Bitola, getting 15.7\\npercent, than in the remainder of the country; and the LP in the\\nBregalnica area got the support of 10.6 percent, substantially\\nhigher than the 3.2 percent support it received overall.\\nQuestion: \"Do you have confidence in the following parties?\" (all\\nnumbers are percentages)\\nYes No Do Not Know\\nSDSM 28 51 21\\nVMRO-DPMNE 15 72 14\\nLP 19 59 22\\nPDP-NDP* 20 73 7\\n*Party for Democratic Prosperity-People\\'s Democratic Party\\nThe poll clearly indicated that Macedonians have little\\nconfidence in any of the parties currently active in the country.\\nRespondents were also asked whether it would be good for the country\\nto have elections sooner than scheduled; 62 percent agreed, 20\\npercent disagreed, and 18 percent did not know. These findings were\\ncorrelated with party preferences, producing the following results:\\nOf those who would vote for the SDSM, 54 percent wanted elections\\nsoon, while 34 percent were against early elections. However, 80\\npercent of VMRO-DPMNE supporters favored elections soon, as did 79\\npercent of LP supporters and 71 percent of DP supporters. While 80\\npercent of those surveyed thought that a person should vote (14\\npercent did not agree), only 40 percent thought that it was very\\nimportant which party won the elections and 27 percent thought it\\nwas somewhat significant.\\n(AUTHOR: GALYEAN.
